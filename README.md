# CollabSync

A full-stack collaboration platform that enables secure file sharing, real-time communication, and scalable cloud deployment.

## Problem Statement

Teams often rely on scattered tools for communication, file sharing, and collaboration, which leads to poor coordination, security concerns, and inefficient workflows. CollabSync was built to unify these core collaboration needs into a single, secure, and scalable platform.

## Key Features

- Full-stack chat and file-sharing functionality with secure user authentication
- Real-time communication using WebSockets for collaborative workflows
- AI-powered meeting note summarization using natural language prompts (OpenAI API, adaptable to Vertex AI)
- Role-based access control and JWT-based authentication for secure sessions
- Containerized application with CI/CD pipelines using Docker and GitHub Actions for cloud deployment

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- RESTful APIs
- Socket.io (real-time communication)
- JWT-based authentication

**AI / ML**
- OpenAI API for meeting note summarization
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- Architecture adaptable to Vertex AI

**DevOps & CI/CD**
- Docker (containerization)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipelines)
- Cloud deployment-ready architecture

**Database & Storage**
- MongoDB
- Secure file storage for uploads

## Engineering Highlights

- Designed and implemented real-time communication workflows using WebSockets
- Integrated AI services into a production-style application using prompt-driven summarization
- Built secure authentication flows with JWT and role-based access control
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines to automate builds and deployments
- Gained hands-on experience designing scalable, full-stack architectures
