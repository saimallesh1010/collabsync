# CollabSync

A full-stack collaboration platform that enables secure file sharing, real-time communication, and scalable cloud deployment.

## Problem Statement

Teams often rely on scattered tools for communication, file sharing, and collaboration, which leads to poor coordination, security concerns, and inefficient workflows. CollabSync was built to unify these core collaboration needs into a single, secure, and scalable platform.
